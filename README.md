# Call-Center-Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on visualising 5 Key Performance Indicators of a company’s Call Centre. These indicators include Total Calls, Duration of All Calls, all 5−Star Calls, and Revenue Generated. It also provides insights into call trends for each month of the year, call trends by gender (Male and Female), and the most productive Call Representatives amongst a host of other crucial insights. It includes an interactive dashboard that displays key performance indicators at a glance for stakeholders to read easily. After cleaning the data and performing some calculations, I made use of numerous Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts and connected them to a Slicer.
## Data Sources
The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle. A world-renowned website for all type of free yet real business data for all types of analysis. The primary dataset for this project is the Call Centre Data csv file, which contains columns such as **Call Representative**, **Customer ID**, **Call Duration**, **Date of Call**, **Customer Number**, **Satisfaction Rating**, and other calculated columns.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning
In this part of the project I performed the following tasks;
1. Data Loading and inspection.
2. Removing white spaces.
3. Formatting columns to their right data types.
4. Replacing missing and NULL values in numerical columns with the mean.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This involved exploring the Call Centre Data to find insights into Key Performance Metrics
1. What is the **Total Call Count** for all Call Representatives?
2. What is the **Total Call Duration** for all Call Representatives?
3. What is the **Average Call Rating** for each call made?
4. How many **5-Star Calls** were recorded?
5. What is the **Weekly Call Trend**?
6. What is the **Monthly Call Trend**?
7. Who is the **Best-Performing Call Representative** by **Total Call Attended To**, **5-Star Calls Ratings Received**, and **Total Revenue Generated** among others.
