# Call-Center-Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on visualising 5 Key Performance Indicators of a company’s Call Centre. These indicators include Total Calls, Duration of All Calls, all 5−Star Calls, and Revenue Generated. It also provides insights into call trends for each month of the year, call trends by gender (Male and Female), and the most productive Call Representatives amongst a host of other crucial insights. It includes an interactive dashboard that displays key performance indicators at a glance for stakeholders to read easily. After cleaning the data and performing some calculations, I made use of numerous Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts and connected them to a Slicer.
